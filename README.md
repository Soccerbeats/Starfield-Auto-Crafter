# Starfield-Auto-Crafter

Starfield Auto Crafter is a clicker script that clicks the keys for you to craft. This is perfect if you are trying to craft thousands of one item in an XP farm and don't want to click and also have it craft faster than you could.

This script runs a loop when you press F1 to Right click, Left click, and then Right click. It will run that loop until you press F2. You can change the keys or the duration inbetween button presses by opening the script with a text editor like notpad++.



# Use:
1. Download AutoHotKey https://www.autohotkey.com/
2. Download the .AHK above 
3. Go ingame to were you will be doing the crafting and open the crafting menu.
4. Go to game settings and change your keybind for Menu Except from E to Right Click.
5. Jump out of game and double click the Starfield Clicker.ahk (AutoHotKey needs to be installed for it to actualy run)
6. Jump back in game and line up your cursor so that your can press the slider to make it 99 items and so you can click the item you are trying to craft.
7. Press F1 to start the clicker.
